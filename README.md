**Description**

This project implements a fully connected neural network from scratch using NumPy
to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal was to gain a deep
understanding of neural network internals, including forward propagation, backpropagation,
gradient descent, and activation functions without relying on deep learning frameworks.
